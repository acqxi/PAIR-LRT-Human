# PAIR-LRT-Human Dataset
This dataset contains pairs of thermal and RGB images captured using a FLIR Lepton3.5 thermal sensor and a Raspberry Pi camera v2, respectively. The dataset includes a total of 33,228 image pairs captured under different environmental conditions, with one human occupant in a standing position and an upper-body pose. The clothing of the occupant is in one of three colors. The images have a heatmap resolution of 16 × 12 and an RGB resolution of 128 × 96, and the field of view for each image is 71◦ × 57◦. The dataset includes two persons.

## Usage
This dataset can be used to generate corresponding color RGB images through thermal imaging. We used this dataset in our paper "*__Privacy-Preserving Video Conferencing via Thermal-Generative Images__*", and a result demo video can be found at [YouTube](https://youtu.be/angJdjjt3Fs)[^1].
